          <Paragraph >           
            Recently defended my PhD in Construction Engineering and Management at the University of Alberta, 
            I am transitioning into my new role as a postdoctoral fellow in worldâ€™s foremost Simulation Lab lead 
            by Dr. Simaan AbouRizk. Prior to my PhD studies, I was a project coordinator/site engineer on a 
            variety of construction projects for 5 years. I experienced the challenges, difficulties, and 
            frustrations of day-to-day construction practices, which led me to return to academic research where 
            I can apply my research skills to improve the construction industry and better my community.
