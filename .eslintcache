It was one of the two things I remembered for that entire course—this candid message \n            and the course title Field Theory and Complex Functions. Yet this simple message has since motivated me \n            to overcome technical challenges and witnessed me growing into an excellent scholar, instructor, and leader. \n          </Paragraph>\n          <Paragraph >\n            Realizing this—the fact that I don’t remember much taught in undergraduate—is liberating, and alarming \n            at the same time, as it led to a series of questions:\n          </Paragraph>\n        \n          <Title level={3}>What role do I play as an educator? </Title>\n          <Paragraph >\n            Early in my education, I became aware of various teaching approaches, particularly their effects on my \n            learning outcomes. In recent years, as I started teaching and coaching (both in higher education and in\n            skiing) I became familiar with different learning preferences (visual, aural, verbal, physical, etc.).\n            Most importantly, I learned to monitor class dynamics, evaluate students’ learning outcome through \n            assorted formative assessments, and carry out reflective and reflexive practices in my class. As such, \n            I slowly but deliberately acquired my teaching toolbox—a variety of active learning exercises and teaching \n            techniques (such as using graphs, charts, and videos, moderating in-class discussions, organizing student \n            presentations, etc.)—to enrich students’ learning experience.  \n          </Paragraph>     \n\n          <Paragraph > \n            Nevertheless, I believe my role as an educator is more than assisting students to succeed in a course \n            or a program, rather it is to set them up to thrive in the rest of their life journeys. As an old Chinese \n            saying goes, “Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a \n            lifetime.” Beyond engaging my students through diverse learning activities, I have been focusing my \n            teaching on designing sustained, significant and positive learning experiences through 1) motivating \n            self-directed learning, 2) nurturing self-directed learning skills, and 3) encouraging inclusivity and \n            diversity. Upon graduation, I hope my students will not only obtain a set of hard skills as a trained \n            engineer, but also a set of soft skills that will support them navigating through any storms their future \n            life imposes. \n          </Paragraph> \n\n          <Title level={5}>Motivation to learn </Title>        \n          <Paragraph >\n            A journey of a thousand miles begins with one single step—motivation. Without it, any journey remains \n            only a dream. My own experience, both as a student and as an instructor, suggests that lack of motivation\n            is often attributed to mismatches of learning and teaching goals. As an instructor, I strive to clearly \n            convey, in both my syllabus and in my class, my teaching philosophy, course objectives and expected learning \n            outcomes. By relating these learning outcomes to their daily life, to the world, and especially to their \n            future careers, I expect to develop long-lasting and self-sustaining motivation in my students. \n          </Paragraph>\n\n          <Paragraph >\n            Additionally, I am fully aware that “every student is a person who is becoming”  —they each have their own personal and career goals. I will maintain honest two-way communication with all students and create an open and positive learning environment, where they feel comfortable to ask questions and seek help. I will actively listen to their concerns and needs, in adjusting my courses content to accommodate a broader interest. By building trust and mutual understanding, I expect to encourage inquiring minds, connect with students with diverse backgrounds and various career goals, thus achieving this critical first step—motivation to learn. \n          </Paragraph>\n\n          <Title level={5}>Ability to learn: soft and hard skills  </Title>        \n          <Paragraph >\n            Today, any factual content is easily and near-instantaneously accessible to students via diverse devices. \n            Rapidly changing technology and society challenge educators to focus on fostering a set of soft skills \n            including life-long learning, interpersonal skills, ethics, and integrity, that will support our students \n            to continue their “thousand-mile journeys” with confidence after graduation. \n          </Paragraph>           \n          <Paragraph >         \n            First, I will continue to organize my lecture materials in a logical and systematic manner that focuses \n            on non-obvious linkages and hidden principles beneath the scattered knowledge areas—demonstrating how to \n            gather meaningful understanding from available factual content. Additionally, I will innovate in how I \n            deliver lectures, conduct assessments, and develop courses, aiming at nurturing critical soft skills through \n            the training of hard skills. For instance, developing group projects to encourage collaborative work; \n            designing open-book exams to assess problem-solving skills; bringing in peer review of assignments to train \n            critical thinking skills; and introducing workshops where students can practice their presentation skills \n            through teaching each other on their chosen/assigned topic—as the Latin principle Docendo discimus: “The \n            best way to learn is to teach”. \n          </Paragraph>\n\n          <Title level={5}>Diversity and inclusivity  </Title>        \n          <Paragraph >\n            I was the black sheep growing up. Conscious of how different I was has made me respect and appreciate the \n            uniqueness of everyone around me. Further, being a ski instructor in a world-class ski resort for the past \n            3 years has trained me to quickly recognize each student’s strengths and weaknesses, assess their learning \n            curves, and develop specific lesson plans to assist them to achieve their personal goals. As a mentor and \n            leader, I aim at seeing everyone as who they are beneath their appearance and helping them realize their \n            potentials.\n            During my 5 years working in the construction industry, I heard numerous empty rhetoric about equity, \n            inclusion, and diversity, while I witnessed and personally experienced the frustration of a glass ceiling. \n            This experience deeply bothered me and urged me back to the higher education system, where I believe a \n            change can truly happen. I will watch out for discursive and systemic barriers to equity and inclusion in \n            the teaching environments, and use them as teaching moments through my practice.\n          </Paragraph>    \n\n          <Title level={3}>What role does higher education play in our society?  </Title>\n          <Paragraph >\n            More than simply assisting in the aggregation, development, and sharing of knowledge, I believe higher education plays a significant role in a democratic society: in educating informed and responsible citizens, thus ensuring a robust democracy. As one component of the higher education system, my influence on my students starts from setting a strong and positive example. To train my students to be accountable, I will be candid and deliver reliably; to cultivate a lifelong learning habit, I will demonstrate my dedication through continuous professional development activities; to encourage inclusivity and diversity, I am committed to helping them find their own identities and expressions of self and voices.  \n\n          </Paragraph>\n          <Title level={3}>Conclusion</Title>\n\n          <Paragraph >\n            Like any skill, it takes practices and deliberate effort to achieve excellence. My teaching and mentoring, like my personality, reflect a passion for lifelong learning. I look forward to overcoming challenges and achieving excellence as I pursue my academic career. \n          </Paragraph>\n\n          <Divider> </Divider>\n          <Title level={1}>Teaching
